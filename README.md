# Wero Adoption Tracker

Track the adoption of the European payment provider [Wero](https://wero-wallet.eu) across banks.

In comparison to other payment providers like PayPal, Wero needs to be implemented by each bank in order to work.  
This can make it hard to know whether a bank already supports Wero, has announced its support, or hasn’t publicly stated any plans.

## Different levels of support

### P2P, e-commerce, and point-of-sale payments

Wero consists of three main parts: peer-to-peer transfers, e-commerce payments, and point-of-sale payments.  
Currently, point-of-sale payments are not implemented by Wero yet, and e-commerce payments have only just started with selected banks.

Each bank has to implement all three parts of Wero separately; therefore, they do not always support all features Wero has to offer.

### Wero app vs. banking app

Some banks decide to implement Wero using their own banking app. Others use the standalone Wero app provided by Wero.
